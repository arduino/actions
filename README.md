# Arduino GitHub Actions

**WARNING**: This repository is used for Arduino's development of experimental
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). They are unstable and not
fully tested. Use at your own risk!

Actions will be moved to dedicated repositories when they are ready for
production usage.

Usage information can be found in their respective folders.

* [arduino/compile-sketches](https://github.com/arduino/compile-sketches) uses
Arduino CLI to do compilation testing of your Arduino library.
  * **WARNING**: The `arduino/actions/libraries/compile-examples` action
  contained in this repository is deprecated. Please use the actively maintained
  `arduino/compile-sketches` action at the link above.

* [arduino/report-size-deltas](https://github.com/arduino/report-size-deltas)
comments on pull requests to provide a report of the resulting change in memory
usage to the Arduino library's example sketch.
  * **WARNING**: The `arduino/actions/libraries/report-size-deltas` action
  contained in this repository is deprecated. Please use the actively maintained
  `arduino/report-size-deltas` action at the link above.

* [arduino/report-size-trends](https://github.com/arduino/report-size-trends)
records the sketch memory usage data reported by the `arduino/compile-sketches`
action in a Google Sheets spreadsheet.
  * **WARNING**: The `arduino/actions/libraries/report-size-trends` action
  contained in this repository is deprecated. Please use the actively maintained
  `arduino/report-size-trends` action at the link above.

* [libraries/spell-check](./libraries/spell-check) checks the files of your
repository for commonly misspelled words.

* [setup-taskfile](./setup-taskfile) makes [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/#/)
available to your Workflows.

---
**Note**: Several actions previously hosted in this experimental repository have
reached stable status and been moved to dedicated repositories:

* [arduino/setup-arduino-cli](https://github.com/arduino/setup-arduino-cli) makes the
[Arduino CLI](https://github.com/Arduino/arduino-cli)
available to your Workflows.

* [arduino/setup-protoc](https://github.com/arduino/setup-protoc) makes the
[protobuf compiler](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)
available to your Workflows.

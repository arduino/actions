# libraries/report-size-trends action

This action records the memory usage of the sketch specified to the [`arduino/actions/libraries/compile-examples` action](../compile-examples)'s [`size-report-sketch` input](../compile-examples/README.md#size-report-sketch) to a Google Sheets spreadsheet.

## Inputs

### `sketches-report-path`

Path that contains the JSON formatted sketch data report, as specified to the `arduino/actions/libraries/compile-examples` action's [sketches-report-path input](../compile-examples/README.md#sketches-report-path). Default `"size-deltas-reports"`.

### `keyfile`

**Required** Contents of the Google key file used to update the size trends report Google Sheets spreadsheet. This should be defined using a [GitHub secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets).
